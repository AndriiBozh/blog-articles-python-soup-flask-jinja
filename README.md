I made this project to practice Python, Beautiful Soup, Flask, and Jinja.
Also, I practiced using CSS with Flask.


what this program does:

This is a web page, with titles of articles (around 20). 
Each title has a link, which, when clicked, opens a new tab with a whole article.
Beneath each title, there's an author of the article and a date, when this article was written.

Titles of articles, references (hrefs), authors and dates are collected from a blog-website, using Beautiful Soup.
